## 1: SplitMe -- Bill Splitting App

This mobile application will help the process of splitting a bill among multiple people. Application of similar purposes exist, but this project aims to reduce the confusion during usage. The application will ask for basic information like number of people and bill amount, and will then ask to create a seating map by creating dots on a screen. It will then ask the price for each item and whom it belonged to until the unsettled amount goes to zero. It will finally display the amount each person owes using the created seat map. 

## 2: AnyLeft -- Household Items Tracker

This mobile application is designed to track the usage of household items (e.g., detergent, etc) and to indicate when to get more. When tracking an liquid item, the user can either key in the approximate % left, or the user can take a photo of the container and mark the bottom, top, and liquid level. For each item, a usage plot and a prediction of future usage will be shown, and the app will remind the user by notification if some items is running low or be running low soon.
