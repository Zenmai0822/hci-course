In the paper *Ninja Cursors*, Kobayashi and Igarashi explored the possibility and efficiency of having multiple cursors moving almost synchronously compared to a single-cursor graphical user interface. These cursors moving in unison have a interlocking mechanism that keeps more than one cursor from moving into a target area. The mechanism would also visualize the additional mouse movement to unlock the desired cursor. In their experiment, cursor types, potential target numbers, and target sizes were manipulated, and the results showed that a modest increase of cursors can significantly increase the efficiency (measured in movement time and movement distance) in less distracting interfaces (i.e., fewer potential targets, larger targets). The paper also discussed the potential tweaks of the multi-cursor system for a real-life graphical user interface (where target arrangements are no longer random, and additional types of interactions are needed), such as utilization of a priority queue, and special handling of dragging behaviors.  


The research seemed to have explored an untouched territory in terms of decreasing the Index of Difficulty (*ID*), and the novelty made the research interesting to read. I have suspected a time-based switching mechanism when multiple cursors are on different targets, but found the visual blocking and queuing mechanism more elegant albeit requiring additional movements for disambiguation. The improvement in terms of efficiency (time) with 2 or 8 cursors is quite significant, but the trade-off of total moving distance becomes quite a disadvantage. I have also liked the discussion of issues and some proposed solutions for real-life implementation, such as the non-random ordering of targets and drag gesture differentiation. It seems like that they are ready and willing to make a multi-cursor system for consumers, with some concerns regarding target disambiguation.  


Meanwhile, the environment of the experiment might be too ideal for real-life usages. When introducing a new interactive system to users, the users should be able to operate it without too much help or instructions, especially when the instrument (mouse, screen, cursor, and GUI) are not novel. The researchers might be able to obtain more realistic data by cold opening the experiment.  


This paper has left quite some space for further researches. In a modern WIMP user interface, users interact with the mouse through more than one ways (secondary click, scrolling, back/forward button for some); and some actions have different consequences depends on the cursor context â€“ primary clicking on an empty space in a window might do nothing, but a secondary click at the same location might offer a menu for the window. One question would be *how can a ninja mouse system handle secondary mouse clicks that is present in most modern WIMP interfaces?*. A differentiate-by-key mechanism might be the easiest to implement, but it would greatly decrease the usability of the system.
